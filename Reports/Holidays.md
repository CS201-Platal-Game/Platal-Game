- For week 6, I refined the `Clock` and `Event` manager.
- I made some edit on Carolina's implementation of the `Quiz`.
- I got to know from others' work how to render and handle inputs, and created a simple `MainMenu`.
- For next week, I will set up an interface for `Clock` and `Event`.

- over the holidays, I set up the map rendering and character movement
- I reworked the destructors for multiple classes in order to prevent memory leaks
- I refactored the texture manager's methods to be more convenient
- I moved the functions relating to protagonist movement to the platal map class, for convenience
- I helped Nina merge her work in the main branch on the parent repo
- for **next week**, i'd like to get as far as possible on showing out all the features everyone has been working on
