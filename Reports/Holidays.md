## Christian Roubert
- Over the holidays I looked into a "Status" object that would appear showing the status of the character
- This renders different status similar to the health or mana we see in some games
- The next week I will work on refining that and then start working on other objects

## Duong Dac
- For week 6, I refined the `Clock` and `Event` manager.
- I made some edit on Carolina's implementation of the `Quiz`.
- I got to know from others' work how to render and handle inputs, and created a simple `MainMenu`.
- For next week, I will set up an interface for `Clock` and `Event`.

## Elouan Gros
- over the holidays, I set up the map rendering and character movement
- I reworked the destructors for multiple classes in order to prevent memory leaks
- I refactored the texture manager's methods to be more convenient
- I moved the functions relating to protagonist movement to the platal map class, for convenience
- I helped Nina merge her work in the main branch on the parent repo
- for **next week**, i'd like to get as far as possible on showing out all the features everyone has been working on

## Thomas Tressel
- Unfortunately, due to a couple issues, I was unable to work much during the holidays.
- As my old laptop had started malfunctioning, I got a new one and managed to install everything necessary for the project to compile and run. Afterwards, I was able to complete working on the CheckCycle method for the dialogue class.

## Tuna Yapakçı

- I added Render() and HandleInput() methods to Dialogue class, and completed the functions necessary to display the dialogue
- I fixed the font manager so that the width of the text gets computed correctly
