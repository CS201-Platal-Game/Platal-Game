- this week i helped Carolina with the testing of the texture manager; we managed to print a character texture to screen!
- this week i also completed the game::update function and setup the link between the game object and the protagonist object
- **next week** i plan on continuing to help the merging of everyone's work; i also plan on importing and linking the 
SDL_TTF library (to display dialogue); finally, i wish that i'll be able to set up a demo with a character that can move 
  on screen
