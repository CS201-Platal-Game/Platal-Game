 - This week I didn't get to do a lot of implementation, but I looked further into tutorials and how to render backgrounds.

This week was rather busy, and unfortunately I didn't have enough time to do what I originally thought I would. I looked more into the functioning of the object class and a possible way to use SDL to give elements of my object class, among others, texture sheets and renderers. Hopefully, we will soon have a functioning texture manager which we could then use with the object class.
