 - This week I didn't get to do a lot of implementation, but I looked further into tutorials and how to render backgrounds.

 - This week I implimented a basic version of chracter movement and handling of keyboard inputs. I also went on a little bug hunt.
 - Next week I will look further into improving the game engine and smoothing out movement with collision and such things.

Unfortunately last week was over packed and I wasn't able to make bigger progress. I was trying to implement some functions in the Map class that would add/remove objects. I tried to create a map from a tuple giving the position to an Object class element. I have to further complete these functions and get famliar with std::map syntax and build-in functions.

This week was rather busy, and unfortunately I didn't have enough time to do what I originally thought I would. I looked more into the functioning of the object class and a possible way to use SDL to give elements of my object class, among others, texture sheets and renderers. Hopefully, we will soon have a functioning texture manager which we could then use with the object class.
