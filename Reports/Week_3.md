 - This week I didn't get to do a lot of implementation, but I looked further into tutorials and how to render backgrounds.

## Duong Dac

- I reviewed PR(s) and fixed implementing errors that others missed. I will look into some GitHub options that prevent merging buggy code.
- I couldn't spend more time for finalizing the structure this week. Next week, I will implement a time (date, second, etc.) mechanism for the game.

- This week i coordinated work between my comrades and helped them when they had trouble understanding the specifications.
- I still haven't had the opportunity to write makefiles, and this task has been relegated due to its low importance.
- **next week** i plan on sorting out all the problems that might arise when everyone pull request their progress; 
I also plan on running some tests to make sure everything interfaces correctly.

 - This week I implimented a basic version of chracter movement and handling of keyboard inputs. I also went on a little bug hunt.
 - Next week I will look further into improving the game engine and smoothing out movement with collision and such things.

This week was rather busy, and unfortunately I didn't have enough time to do what I originally thought I would. I looked more into the functioning of the object class and a possible way to use SDL to give elements of my object class, among others, texture sheets and renderers. Hopefully, we will soon have a functioning texture manager which we could then use with the object class.
