- This week I completed the map rendering, or at least the Map::Draw, which takes the map array and depending on the value renders different textures, using the different SDL functions and texture managers. This next week I will refine the map rendering if needed. 

## Duong Dac
- This week I finished the time manager `clock` and part of the activities manager `synapses`. I also did some code review. Next week, I will probably work with the graphic team on `map`, movements, and objects.

## Elouan Gros
- This week i worked on the merging of pple's work. I managed to integrate the changes made to the texture manager
- I set up and created an interface to the sdl_ttf library in the form of a font manager 
- I created a demo that shows off both the work done on the texture manager and the work done on the font manager
- for **next week** i plan on having a movable character in front of a dynamic map

## Carolina Nina Matos
- This week I created some header files related to the quiz and question classes, and tried to implement some of the methods
Next week, I will continue working on this, as I need some help in order to complete the methods. I also need to think about how the quiz is going to be rendered.
